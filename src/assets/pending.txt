Create static page layout:
    Display images using a css grid.

Create the countries object, it should have:
    The code or abbreviation of the name of the country.
    The name of the country.
    Maybe instead of a JSON file it should a JS Function,
        that when it's called returns a random array of 'N' countries,
        checking that a instance isn't repeated.
